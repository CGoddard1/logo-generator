# SVG Logo Maker

## About this Project
The objective of this project was to make an application that generates an SVG image file using user input. To begin the process, the user will first open the command line inside the project and type 'node index.js'. The user will then receive a series of prompts to help design their logo. Using the user's answers, the application creates a simple SVG image titled 'logo.svg' that can be viewed and downloaded.
